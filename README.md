# How Panicked Should I Be?
A lighthearted attempt to put disease death rates into perspective

# Two notes for epidemiologists
First, I'm going to fully admit that this makes enough simplifying assumptions to render this factually useless.  Just one example: normalizing all death rates against US data, even though this is laughably incorrect for rest-of-world.

Second, if you've got suggestions that are within the spirit of the project, please open a new ticket on GitHub and let's make this less factually wrong! (While still keeping the spirit of what it's aiming for, which is to be a counterpressure to media-induced panic.)
