# Two notes for epidemiologists
First, I'm going to fully admit that this makes enough simplifying assumptions to render this factually useless.

Second, if you've got suggestions that are within the spirit of the project, please open a new ticket on GitHub and let's make this less factually wrong! (While still keeping the spirit of what it's aiming for, which is to be a counterpressure to media hype.)
